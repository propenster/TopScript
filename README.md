# TopScript

**A dynamic interpreted scripting language written from scratch in C#**

**This is to confirm the fact that there is now absolutely nothing (sounding overly confident) that I have not built using C# (the most elegant high-level language there is)** - Ratio this 🪨 😲 😆 💩

- Lexing for dummies
- Parsing for dummies
- AST
- Runtime from scratch
